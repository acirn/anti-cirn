# Anti CIRN

We are pledged to do whatever we can to stop countries that threaten the peace of the model world.
Мы обязуемся сделать все возможное, чтобы остановить страны, которые угрожают миру модельного мира.

## What is CIRN?

CIRN includes the most peace-threating countries, including but not limited to:

- Russia: [invaded Ukrian since 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)
- China: [will never renounce right to use force over Taiwan](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-china-will-never-renounce-right-use-force-over-taiwan-2022-10-16/)
- Iran: [sends drones to Russia to aid their war against Ukrian](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/01/uk-minister-iran-made-big-mistake-in-giving-drones-to-russia-for-ukraine-war/)
- North Korea: [threads a nuclear war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/north-korea-fires-2-missiles-into-sea-continuing-nuclear-threat-escalation)

## Why Anti CIRN

These countires are seeking war, which essentially takes lives from humans against their will. Worst of all, when people are inside a war zone, there are usually very few things they can do to protect themselves.

## What do we do

### Promoting Anti CIRN open source licenses

Open source benefits everyone in the world. Unfortunately, it also benefits countries that are seeking war. So we, Anti CIRN, are seeking of blocking these countries... (WIP)
