# Anti CIRN

We are pledged to do whatever we can to stop countries that threaten the peace of the model world.

Мы обязуемся сделать все возможное, чтобы остановить страны, которые угрожают миру модельного мира.

## What is CIRN?

CIRN includes the most peace-threating countries, including but not limited to:

- Russia: [invaded Ukrian since 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)
- China: [will never renounce right to use force over Taiwan](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-china-will-never-renounce-right-use-force-over-taiwan-2022-10-16/)
- Iran: [sends drones to Russia to aid their war against Ukrian](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/01/uk-minister-iran-made-big-mistake-in-giving-drones-to-russia-for-ukraine-war/)
- North Korea: [threads a nuclear war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/north-korea-fires-2-missiles-into-sea-continuing-nuclear-threat-escalation)

## Why Anti CIRN

These countires are seeking war, which essentially takes lives from humans against their will. Worst of all, when people are inside a war zone, there are usually very few things they can do to protect themselves.

## What do we do

### Promoting Anti CIRN open source licenses

Open source benefits everyone in the world. Unfortunately, it also benefits countries that are seeking war. So we, Anti CIRN, or Acirn, are seeking of blocking these countries from taking advantage of people's good will, and use them for war related purposes.

Our approach is quite simple: we are adding an "Anti CIRN header" in front of some open source licenses, and we will be using these in our own open source projects. You can choose one of them to include them in your own open source projects.

### The ANTI CIRN LICENSE header

```
ANTI CIRN NOTICE: "This software" includes any part of the contents of this repository.

All legal entities, who pay tax to the following "CIRN" countries, shall not use this software in any form, including but not limited to releasing, modifying, referencing, publishing, compiling, building, using it as a tool, using it as education material, and so on. 

CIRN country list:
- Russia
- China (Not including Taiwan)
- Iran
- North Korea

If any of the following parts of the license file contradict against the parts above, the above is preferred and has higher priority.

Any derivative software that contains parts of this software shall have all the "Anti CIRN" contents, including all texts above and this line, in their own license file.

---

```

### Modifying the ANTI CIRN LICENSE header

We allow anyone to modify our header. You are encouraged to modify the "CIRN country list" section based on your preference. Furthermore, you may want to remove the last line to make your software not "contagious".

Furthermore, you are even authorized to publish your own "anti-Anti CIRN" licenses, because:

## Q & A

**Are you allowed to modify the open source licenses?**

Some licenses, like GPL, explicitly states that changing them is not allowed. In this case we are not going to publish any Acirn versions.

For other licenses, this question can be breakdown into multiple sections.

- **Are we authorized to modify these licenses?** No, we aren't. And we doubt if we will ever be authorized to do so.
- **Can we modify these licenses?** Yes, we can, although we must accept the legal consequence if we choose to do so.
- **What will the copyright owners do, and what will you do?**
  - They may do nothing. In this case, we will keep publishing these Acirn licenses so that people who are interested can use.
  - They may not want their names to be associated with our modified licenses, and allow us to keep publishing them. In this case, we will rename and republish them.
  - They may ask us to stop publishing their licenses. They may contact us by email, submit a GitHub issue, and so on. In this case, we will remove our modified version of the copyright owner's license.
  - They may complain to GitHub and ask for taking down our repos or even account. In this case, it is up to GitHub to decide what to do.
  - They may take legal action against us. In this case, we will try to go with judicial mediation process allowed or required by the local law. If they insist to go to the court, we will ask our supports for donation to help us get it through.
- **Additionally, why do you choose to do it even with potential legal risks?** Because we trust what we are doing is the right thing.

**Does Acirn licenses defeat the purpose of open source itself?**

Unfortunately, it kind of is. Different people have different aspects of view about the purpose of open source, but in general, as developers, we always love to share our work. However, we don't believe Acirn should be blamed for our licenses. The countries that use open source software for the purpose of war should be blamed.

**But not all people in these countries are part of the war?**

This statement is subjective. Most of Acirn members come from these Acirn countries ourselves, and we need to remind you that these countries run very differently than the free world countries. Thinking about the US: almost all people living in America need to pay federal tax, which goes to fund the US army. In Aiorn countries, the states own most of the resources, so almost any activity people do in these countries, are supporting their regimes.

We would like to say something like "people who support Acirn countries are not allowed to use this software", but the definition of "support" is subjective. So we use a more explicit expression instead. Besides, in these countries, if some people are against their government, they are most likely not big enough in numbers; and if they are not big enough, in Acirn countries, they usually don't care about our licenses.

**How do you enforce these licenses?**

Of course, we can't enforce these licenses, if the violation happens in Acirn countries, and we don't encourage anyone who uses our license to do so either. The moment we file a complaint in these countries, we will probably be put in jail. The purpose of our licenses is firstly about delivering a message, and if the corporations who violate our license also have assess in other countries, legal actions can be taken to compensate copyright owners.
